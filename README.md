# MoviesCorrelation
This is a correlation about movie features using python and a movie dataset from Kaggle. I did it in Jupyter notebooks but you can run the file in your favorite editor
I used python libraries Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.
I loaded the dataset, checked the percentage of missing values, dropped the nulls in the rows that had a significant percentage of Missing values and the duplicates.
Then I created a scatterplot, and a scatterplot with a regression line and finally a heatmap
Last, I paired the correlations and filtered the weakest correlations
